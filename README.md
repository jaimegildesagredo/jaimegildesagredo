# Jaime Gil de Sagredo Luna

Passionate about building high-quality software products that deliver value to users. With a focus on fast, iterative and user-driven development, I specialize in developing both MVPs and long-term products using cost and time sustainable processes.

My core practices and experience encompass a wide range of methodologies, including eXtreme Programming, Simple Design, Lean and DevOps. I am well-versed in Test-Driven Development (TDD), Domain-Driven Development (DDD), and Hexagonal architecture, which enable me to build robust and scalable software solutions.
